# auto-clicker-lua
Simple auto clicker lua script for **Logitech** Script system.

Attention, the inaccuracy can be up to 1-3 click, since the Sleep() function **ONLY accepts integers**,
So milliseconds for sleep are rounding because float just brokes everything.

PS: only after upload i noticed that limits of autoclicker is 66 cps ;(

# todo:
- [ ] Make it accurate?
